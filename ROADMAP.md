Roadmap
*******

- option to rotate screen (boot/config.txt = display_rotate=2 https://github.com/Evilpaul/RPi-config/blob/master/config.txt
- mapper remote: moving has quite a big delay, fix this
- make mapper working without mouse
- button to manualy load a mouse connected after boot
- change the startscripts with option -b to blank screen
- Slow motion function (1 Increase Speed 2 Decrease Speed) (dbus control no ready yet, waiting for new omxplayer version)
- Sync in seamless loop 

- adding an OSC wrapper for remote control (https://wiki.openlighting.org/index.php/OLA_DMX_Trigger) e.g. select video1 and play, stop.

- sync for slideshow
- Master Slave auto-detection
- integrate LTC / SMPTE function (https://github.com/x42/libltc)
- adding manual slideshow function which also plays movies (placed in images folder)
- user can define RJ45 Network adress by himself

- a simple text tool to overlay text infos (e.g. displaying showtimes) (with subtitle function?)
- adding support of wireless/bluetooth mouse in mapping mode (e.g. Logitech MX)
- adding a function to check filenames, when there is a space, auto rename with _ , remove 'umlauts'
- screen controls for color, brightness, contrast (openframeworks solution?)
- adding a screen recorder to record a TCPSyphon stream (maybe possible with RPI3)
- Make sync script compatible with video mapper 
- Automaticly convert incompatible movies to h264  (PocketVJ 3 release), when finished picture with smiley:finshed ;-)
- Integrate RaspiVJ function for videomixing (http://w.xuv.be/projects/raspivj#raspivj)
- Artnet output for lightning control
