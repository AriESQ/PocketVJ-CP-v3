## Roadmap
**********

### Priority:

- rewrite update script to force remove content in ofxPiMapper/example/bin/data/sources/videos, recheck to mapper update process!
- port the new pjlink commands from Exhibition
- upgrade the image to new 5.x kernel, make tests and release
- prevent bootloops when pusing reboot and browser reconnects (anyone a hint?)
- add omxplayer error echo/output when setting to alsa/usb audio but no soundcard is recognized
- add countdown
- Update the osc_control.js (startlesser scripts)
- add wireless-power off to interfaces ?
- fix the new filebrowser, is it a permission issue or a service issue?
- add mapper hdmi audio, where is the bug?
- create my own gitea server on pocketvj domain, move everything from here to gitea to be more free

### Tutorials: <br />

- Show how to use mapper without mouse  <br />
