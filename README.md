If you want to use PiMapper you must install openframeworks: http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/raspberry-pi-2-setup-guide/18690, change the keyboard commands in ProjectionMappingState.cpp (Backslash to 'd') and then install and compile PiMapper https://github.com/kr15h/ofxPiMapper, then you have to simulate a fake keyboard to unleash the remote control, see here: 
http://www.fsays.eu/Blogging/Blog/Details/23

install this for mouse remote (not sure if it works):

sudo wget http://remotepi.io/drivers/remotepi_1.0.15_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i remotepi_1.0.15_armhf.deb
sudo /etc/init.d/remotepi start
